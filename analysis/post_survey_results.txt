2	18-19	Based on virtual lab results, the charge vs. plate separation graph was exponentially decreasing, so the s term should be s^2. Everythign else is linear and should be fine. The amount of charge and voltage should be in absolute value brackets.	The negative should not be there because it only works for when the voltage is negative. Therefore, both sides of the equation should just have absolute value brackets. Everything else is correct based off the linear patterns of increasing voltage and area and the exponential decrease of charge as separation increases.

6	18-19	According to the formula as either or all of V and A increase, charge should increase and as s increases, charge should decrease. This seems correct to me.\nHowever I had initially thought that Q would be the product of V, A and 1/s. 	This seems correct appart from the negative sign. According to this formula, A=-Qs^2 /V. If Q and V are both positive then A would be negative. This is not possible.\nI also think that the denominator should be s and not s^2. s^2 usually applies when we're thinking of volumes of spheres or point sources but this is neither so it shouldn't have a power in my opinion.

8	18-19	I believe that most aspects of the formula are correct. This is because voltage, area and separation all influence the charge on a plate. However, one things i would change is to put an absolute value sign for voltage because voltage can be negative and therefore make the whole term negative. This is contradicting becuase a larger voltage should infer a larger charge. Other than that, i believe the equation is correct. 	I believe that the negative sign in front of V is incorrect because if a positive voltage was given, the charge (Q) should be positive.

One thing I worry about in this formula is the applied negative sign on the voltage x area section of the equation. Since it will be divided by the separation, which is always a positive number, then the charge will constantly end up negative, which isn't necessarily accurate unless the voltage is actually a negatively charged volt.

19	18-19	The V with the battery voltage is wrong. The voltage being negative or positive does not affect the charge so in the equation, there needs to be a way to make it always positive, such as taking its square. The A and s seem reasonable as A is an addition relation and is directly proportional to the charge and s is a subtraction equation and it is inversely proportional to the charge. 	The V is still wrong because it doesn't show that the number being positive or negative doesn't make a difference. Dividing by s^2 makes sense since it's inversely proportional and exponential.

27	18-19	Voltage has an effect on the overall charge regardless of the other two factors because it determines the sign of the charge (+/-); therefore, it should be multiplied by everything. This is because Q and V are positively proportionate. Q and s are inversely proportionate so everything should be divided by s. Simply subtracting by s does not take into account this proportional relationship between Q and s.	The plate separation dividing the other factors makes sense in this case because of the inverse proportionate relationship between Q and s. The negative sign is most likely incorrect because a positive voltage gives a positive charge and a negative voltage gives a negative charge.

41	18-19	The formula is correct that the voltage, the plate area, and the plate separation are the factors that affect the amount of charge on the plate. It is incorrect that they are addition and subtraction, because they are all linear or inverse relationships, so they should be multiplied or divided. Area and voltage is linear so it is multiplied, while separation is inverse so it should be divided.	Separation is inversely related, so there is no square on the s. Area is correct because when area increases the charge increases. The voltage is absolute because the magnitude is the same, so it does not need to be negative.

I plotted it on the graph in the lab to try to find the mathematical relationships between them.

42	18-19	Voltage and area in the formula are correct since they are directly proportional to the increase in charge on the plates. As voltage and area increase, so does the charge. The separation, however, is incorrect, since it is inversely proportional to the charge and thus should be in the denominator. As the separation increases, the charge decreases.	The voltage sign is incorrect because the pole that is connected to a certain plate transmits to it the charge that it had in the first place with its respective sign. The area is correct because it is directly proportional to the charge in a linear manner. Separation is also correct since its increase causes a decrease in the charge in an exponential manner.

In the second virtual lab I took more time to examine the graphs with content already made and compared those to the ones that I produced using gathered data. 	The making of the graphs worked well due to the fact that it helps with visualization.

The negative seems incorrect because the results were not negative. Also, the separation (s) did not affect the charge as much as the area (A) did so it should not be squared.

45	18-19	The fact the formula positively combines voltage and area and subtracts seperation is correct as V and A increase while charge increases and when seperation increases charge decreases, but I'm not sure if it is possible to just add them vs multiplying them. Also seperation vs charge had a graph that looked like the function 1/x, so merely subtracting it might not work (V and A are linearly related to charge). Possibly the constants make up for these discrepancies.  	This formula looks closer to what I envisioned as true. V and A are both linearly proportional to charge so they can be multiplied, and plate seperation is put in the 1/x format I described in my previous answer. (The graph of charge vs seperation looks like 1/x). I'm not sure why there is a negative sign, possibly could be removed.

Finding trends worked well. I don't know if I would do anything differently.

Therefore, s should be divided in the formula, not subtracted.	Again, plate separation only had an inverse relationship (1/x) and should not be squared. There also should not be a negative sign in the formula because the sign of the charge always correlated with the sign of the battery voltage during the activity. However, whether the battery voltage is directly/linearly related to charge could not be determined from the activity because no numerical value was given for the voltage.

In this second lab in particular, I learned about charge and how area, separation, and battery voltage affects it.	Again, being able to take data and plot them on graphs was very helpful in determining the relationships between each factor and charge. I did not know the plates could be moved so that they did not perfectly align with each other and that is something I would like to test next time.

The negative component of this formula is the separation as it can be related to understanding that the more distance there is to the plate, the less charge there is.	I do not think there should be a negative in the equation as the plate separation is squared and everything else is positive in regards to the units.

The other portions of the formula are correct, since charge shares a positive relationship with plate area, and charge shares a negative relationship with place separation. 	This formula is correct, because with the variable of plate separation in the denominator, a larger plate separation will result in a smaller charge, while a smaller plate separation will result in a larger charge. Area is correctly placed in the numerator, because area has a positive correlation with charge.

5		L is not necessary, as the laser path length makes no difference to the absorbance A.\n? is wrong, because A is not linearly proportional to ?.

6		I'd say they are all correct based on the graphs I obtained during the virtual lab. c and L seemed to be directly proportional to A. I don't know the exact relationship of A with lamda but it could be directly proportional. I would have to plot a graph to find out for sure. However, lamda could not be assigned to either axis on the graph so I couldn't really investigate this. \nHowever my graphs didn't seem like they would pass through the origin so maybe the formula is missing some sort of constant or maybe it is because of experiment error	I dont think that A is proportional to V. A is probably proportional to the thicknesss of the beaker or the volume of solution the laser must pass through but A wont be proportional to the volume of solution in the beaker as a really thin tall beaker would have low absorbance but a lot of volume of solution.\nA seems like it is proportional to N as when the concentration increases, the laser would pass through more molecules in its path. When concentration was increased, Absorbance also increased linearly.\n							46792161			Next time I would have varied two variables while keeping everything else the same and measuring the effect of this on absorbance.\nFor example, I wouldve seen if thickness is proportional to absorbance at different wavelengths of light.

7		From the formula above, A is directly proportional to c. This is correct. Higher concentration would mean more particles per unit volume, more light is absorbed giving higher absorbance.\nFrom my experimentation, wavelength of light affects the absorbance in a unique way. We have to first know the color of the solution as different colors of solution absorbs different amount of same-colored light. For example, red solution absorbs red light the most as compared to other colored solution. Wavelength of light should not be placed in the formula since it should be considered on a case-to-case basis. \nFor L, absorbance is not affected significantly if light is shined horizontally. The factor that affects the absorbance is the angle of light being shined onto the beaker. We should include angle in the formula instead of the path length L.	Having a constant for different solution is correct. \nA increases proportionally to N is correct, more particles mean more absorbance.\nHigher volume also gives higher number of molecules given same concentration, so higher absorbance. This is correct as well.							24511163			I have only used virtual labs on the subject that I have already known before hand, so they appears quite boring to me since I'm able to expect all of the outcomes. \nI should try virtual labs on things that I am not familiar with.

8		The laser wavelength affects the absorption relative to the spectrum of the solution, and has nothing to do with it's absolute value.\nAssuming absorbance is a unitless value, the units in the formula don't cancel out.\n\n 	V should be the path length of the laser, not the volume of the beaker							31607164			Using intuition to identify trends.

9		concentration times L seems to be correct because when they are both increased individually the absorbance increases, however the wavelength had an exponential looking graph ao it does not seem right that it would be multiplied by these values. Where the wavelength equals zero when the c and L are held constant, the wavelngth still has a value so i belive wavelength should be on the bottom of the right had side of the equation.	this equation seems to be accurate because K can never be zero and the absorbance does increase with an increase in the volume and molarity of the solution.							59043165			being able to play around with the differnet variable so easily and not having to do everything by hand (ie change molarity adn get different beakers ect) was very nice. more specific instrucitons on what to look for while conducting the experiment would have been nice as I wasnt sure how to answer some of the post activity questions.

13		I'm not quite sure whether this would be correct or not, considering when I did the lab I did not consider formulas no mathematical equations; I solely considered the applicable theories and possible rules of what would contribute to absorption or not.	I believe here, K and V are good to be multiplied in regards to the formula, however the amount of molecules of the solution in the path of laser should be divided.							55825144			What worked well was manipulating the variables one at a time in multiple different ways to see the true effect it would have on the outcome.

14		The concentration of the solution in the simulation seemed to have a much greater effect on the light absorbance of the solution, thus I think that the formula is incorrect in the case of the concentration. 	I believe that this formula is incorrect because the entire volume of the solution in the beaker does not matter, only the volume in the path of the laser matters. 							60000168			I liked that it was mostly self explanatory.

15		the formula is partially correct because as the concentration and the laser path length through the solution increases, absorbency should also increase. However, as the wavelength of the light decreases, absorbency should increase, so there should be a reverse proportionality for the wavelength and the absorbency. 	this formula is partially correct because number of molecules is the same thing as concentration, and when the concentration increases, the absorbency should also increase but the volume of solution in the beaker shouldn't matter as long as the laser goes through the same width of the solution. 							86699164			I would try to memorize the results so that I could answer the post-question in more detail 	Definitely	Not at all	Somewhat	Somewhat	Often	Almost never	Sometimes	Almost never	Often	high concentration (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/23165/storage/absorbance%20empty%20laser/setup_wide_dark_green.png)		 (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/groups/5494/equal%20(1).png)	big beaker (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/23165/storage/absorbance%20empty%20laser/setup_wide_light_green.png)	 (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/groups/5494/equal%20(1).png)	angled laser beam (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/23165/storage/setup_narrow_light_green_crooked2.png)	the angled laser light is going through more of the solution therefore, more light will be absorbed by the solution 	red laser beam (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/23165/storage/absorbance%20empty%20laser/setup_narrow_dark_red.png)	red laser beam has a longer wavelength than blue light so more of it can be absorbed by the solution 	0.1		0.4		0.8		0.5		Not at all	Not at all	Somewhat	Not at all	Mostly	Mostly	Not at all	Not at all	Mostly	Mostly	Not at all	Somewhat	Somewhat	Somewhat	Definitely	Mostly	Not at all	Somewhat	Somewhat	Not at all	Mostly	Definitely	Not at all	Mostly	Mostly					Absorbance	1	86699164
16		Correct aspects include the linear relationships between A&c and A&L. However, the wavelength does not have a linear relationship to the absorbency and should be left out of this equation.	This is far more accurate a formula, because k is now a constant specific to a given wavelength that scales N and V to the correct proportion.							78992166			I wouldn't change what I did next time, although it would be nice to have had more specific guidelines.

17		Absorbance has no units. However in this formula absorbance would be left with the units of millilitres pr metre (mL/m). Therefore there must be another component that affects the absorbance that was no included in the simulation. 	The volume of solution in the beaker has no influence on the absorbance measured. The laser will interact with the same number or particles as long as it is still passing in a straight line through the length of solution. 							13193166			I would definitely explore my tools more thoroughly next time. I did not think to try to move the beaker towards or away from the detector.

18		The ? is definitely incorrect. Multiplying the concentration and laser path length is definitely correct. Laser wavelength cannot be in a equation without the wavelength of the solution because it affects absorbency by being similar to the solution wavelength. 	N makes sense because it is basically how concentration affects the absorbance. I don't know what attenuates light means but I'm guessing it means something similar to reflect, in which case it would make sense as absorbance is measured by how much light that was at the beginning does not reach the sensor. The V is definitely wrong, as the volume of the solution is unrelated to how much solution the light travels through. 							19780165			If there's more time for virtual labs i would probably write out a graph and calculate the slope of some relationships to know whether it's actually linear.

19		There is an odd case in which very high power (short wavelengths) have a very slightly higher absorbance. This equation would not account for that (outlier?) case. \nI wish I'd written down the numbers I graphed so I could crunch the numbers, however the rest of the equation seems rigorous. Absorbance scaled linearly as concentration or width increased. 	The absorbance depends on the path length of the light and not the volume. You could have a beaker that holds 10000L and one that holds 1L. So long as the distance that the light beam travels through either one is the same, and assuming all other factors (e.g concentration) are held the same, then the absorbance should be the same as well. 							18365162			I wish I'd actually written down a few numbers and then tested out a few different scenarios (different wavelengths/concentrations/widths) and checked to see if I could write an equation that would provide me the same answers. \n\nThen I would have tested if that equation held up under different scenarios (such as with different wavelengths). \n\nLastly, I'd see what would happen if I started messing around with changing multiple things at once.

20		the laser wavelength might be inversely proportionate to the absorbance A of a solution.\nThe formula is not correct overall.	The volume of the solution in the beaker is directly proportionate to the absorbance A of a solution.\nHowever, I am not sure about how the number of molecules of the solution in the path of the laser will affect the absorbance A of a solution at wavelength = 532nm.\n							11997159			I changed several factors to see if it will affect the absorbance of a solution, but I did not measure all the possibilities, like will the distance of of path affect the absorbance of a solution.

21		I do think that the concentration of the solution plays a key roll in determining light absorbency. As seen in the prior project, as concentration increased, the absorbency of light also increased. Wavelength also determines light absorbency, seen when certain colors displayed a greater absorbency than others. The laser path length is unjustifiable by my findings, a variable that I did not take into consideration when conducting the experiment. 	The number of molecules in the solution, also thought of as concentration of the substance holds true for the formula since concentration has a direct relationship with the strength of absorbency of light. The volume also played a key roll in the absorbency of light, with a greater volume resulting in a greater concentration. Since wavelengths differ from color to color, it is important that there is a constant referring to each particular wavelength, so that variable is also correct. 							14293162			"Mostly all parts of the lab went well.

22		The formula is correct in that, in the formula, A is proportional to c and L, which is what we found in our virtual lab. However, it was not proportional to lambda, ad there was a huge increase going from red dark-red/infrared. It appeared that A was not directly proportional to lambda. Finally, a proportionality factor may need to be used to match the absorbance units with that of the other side (such as the k in the equation for electrostatic force, or G in gravitational force)	We know that V was not important in determining absorbance, since the extra volume would not interfere with the laser at all. Therefore, V should not be in the equation. N is technically a good variable to use, but it is incredibly difficult finding the number of molecules of the solution i the path of the laser. A better equation would involve the width of the beaker and the height of the laser and the concentration of the solution.							16752165			"I think the implementation of the graph helped, but I was not completely aware of how it worked until later in the lab. It definitely helped me understand the relationships between the different variables and the absorbance. I didn't really use the notes, since writing on paper is a lot simpler and you can draw diagrams with it. The one thing the lab misses is ambiguity and errors: since it's a virtual lab, you don't get to actually ""measure"" left; rather, you're just inputting information into the computer and getting a result back.

23		all are correct. Observations showed that absorbance is directly related to the wavelength, concentration, and path length. As all of these factors increased so did the absorbance measured. 	According to my understanding, N resembles the concentration of the solution which is indeed directly corresponding to the absorbance, and V resembles the quantity of liquid referring to the volume which is directly corresponding to the absorbance as well. If those are such, then the formula should be correct, since k considers the wavelength, even if it is a specific one it works in this precise scenario.							15072160			Something I would do differently is maybe pay more attention to the absorbance measured outside of the solution, seen as there were various questions on such and I did not notice that with so much attention. Also, I would come up with a possible formula so I could formulate the precise relation in a quantitative manner between the factors and absorbance.

27		I do not know which are correct or incorrect as I did not pay much attention to the actual values. Instead, I just looked at them relative to another, so I cannot say for certain what the mathematical relationship would look like. I do think that absorbance is directly proportional to concentration, path length, and wavelength.	I think it is correct that A is directly proportional to N and V as absorbance increased when concentration increased and when increasing width of beaker (resulting in volume increase) absorbance increased again.							13228164			I would pay more attention to the numbers for each trial individually.

28		Absorbance is positively correlated to the concentration of the solution and the length through the solution. Wavelength of the laser is important to consider when the solution is known or the colour of the solution is known. Some solutions will only absorb certain wavelengths of light. Increasing or decreasing the wavelength will give information only when the solution is known as well.	N and V should not be multiplied. N over V would give a value of concentration (e.g. mol/L). The constant can then be multiplied by the concentration to give the absorbance. Higher concentrations would result in a higher amount of absorption. A = kN/V would be more appropriate.							13726167			I didn't get a chance to play around with all the variables.

29		As the wavelength of the laser decreases after around 550nm, the absorbency increases so I do not believe that the wavelength would be multiplied. 	I agree with most of the formula except for the volume. It is only the distance the light travels through the solution in a beaker that would affect the absorbency. A higher water level would have no effect. As the concentration or number of mols in a solution increases, the absorbency would also increase.							7868168			I would spend more time taking specific trials to test a theory.

30		The length and concentration are both directly proportional , to the absorbance. However the wavelength does not have a linear relationship with the absorbance, instead we likely observe the wavelength of light determining the proportion of light absorbed, but is expected to decrease on both sides of the visible spectrum.	This formula does not take into account the height of the container in relation to the width(distance the light must travel). Two containers tall and skinny vs short but wide like a disc will have different absorbance readings, due to the distance the light must travel.							17502161			The varying of the distances and concentration helped me piece together whether it was a linear relationship, although I already knew the answer. Since it was a laser, the distance to the absorbance reader did not make a difference, whereas if it was an incoherent light source, it would have made a difference.\nNext time I would check what variables I am able to plot before I begin recording data, so that I waste time.

31		The presence of concentration in the formula is correct, because based on different tests, we observed that concentration does indeed affect the absorbance. However, the Laser wavelength does not appear to be affecting the absorbance at all, therefore should not be included in the equation.\nSecondly, there should be a Length present in the equation, but that should not be of the laser path, because overall we can assert that none of the quantities directly related to the laser itself are really affecting the absorbance. Instead the width of the container in which the solution exists, should be present in the formula.	Absorbance cannot be detected based on any constant values, because it keeps changing as different factors change. Therefore, we cannot have K value in the equation.\nHowever, the presence of volume is necessary in the formula.\nMeanwhile, number of molecules is not of importance.							12406161			I thought very critically and it was what we already studied in physics 158 course.

33		All aspects of the formula seem correct. L is essentially the beaker width. 	V, volume of solution. Again, the virtual lab didn't suggest that changing the volume of the solution would lead to a change in light absorbance.							18162165			I thought the graph plotting was efficient.

34		All seems true because if you increase one of the three variables, the absorbance would increase. The absorbance of the solution increased as the wavelength, concentration or distance from the laser increased. If one of the three variables was lowered the absorbance would decrease but not b much. If all three were at their minimum the absorbance would be really low.	I do not think the V variable is correct because as the volume would decrease the absorbance would increase compared to all other variables. If the k or N were to increase so would the absorbance.							10908162			Next time I would graph more of the data, i would also be more familiar with the system and would not have to try everything before actuallly conducting my expirement.

35		It is partially because the absorbance is in proportion with the concentration of the solution and the laser path length through the solution. When both of these increases, the absorbance increases. However, the wavelength is not directly proportional to the absorbance. It should be the farther away from the absorbed wavelength of the solution, the higher the absorbance. Therefore, the wavelength in the equation should be the wavelength of the laser minus the wavelength of the absorption of the solution\n	The volume of the solution is not significant in this formula, but rather the length of the solution that the laser passes through. N is correct because the higher the concentration (the larger number of molecules), the larger the absorbance. k should be inversed, because if there is higher retention of light of the solution, there would be less absorbance of the detector							16237162			I was able to identify key factors that determine absorbance, and make a general conclusion on their relationships. For next time, I would make more graphs and more specifically analyze the influence of each factor.

36		From the simulation, it does not seem that the wavelength in nm has such a direct relationship with absorbance. It does not seem accurate to use it in this formula in such a way. However, the concentration and path length aspect of the formula seem more or less correct, as they are directly proportional to Absorbance.	Number of molecules multiplied by volume does not really give you anything resembling concentration and path length.\nThe constant k seems to have a place in this formula, if it had path length and concentration instead of N and V.							14002169			Enjoyed the simplicity of recording data .

37		All aspects of the formula seem to be correct, however concentration would most likely be measured in moles rather than milimoles like in the simulation. Compared to the experiment, the formula could be correct as the milimoles would be converted to moles, resulting in a low number in which laser path length (converted from cm to m) would multiply with. Then, their product could multiply with the laser wavelength, most likely measured in meters. As I cannot remember my wavelengths length in the visible light spectrum, the formula could be correct. 	I believe that the volume is incorrect as the volume of the beaker doesn't matter. what matters is how much of it the light hits as it passes through the beaker, which in this case is N (the number of molecules), otherwise known as the concentration. k could be correct as it refers to a specific situation, ie, when light is at a certain wavelength. A, k, and N could be correct, but V is not. 							17114169			Playing around to understand how the simulation worked well as well as plotting my graph to have a graphical representation of what my data looked like. It clearly outlined my discoveries. Next time, I would see if I could change the angle of the laser at which it goes through the light, see if I could change the medium the light passes through, and try to increase the amount of light absorbed to see what could get the highest possible absorbency within the simulation.

38		? is correct, as established through the virtual lab.\nc is correct, since the higher the concentration the more absorbency of the solution.\nL is correct, since the laser path length through the solution is equal to the width of the beaker, which was shown to be correct through the virtual lab.	k is correct, since this is how absorbency for different wavelengths is determined.\nN makes sense but I'm not entirely sure it is correct.\nV is incorrect and plays no part in determining the absorbency of the solution, so long as the volume is high enough that the light passes through the solution.							12263156			I really just played around with the simulation and tried to grasp the physics through what I was changing.

39		As concentration goes up, so does absorbance, and they are directly proportional as it goes up in a linear manner, so c is correct. The laser path through the solution, however, if relating to the angles, does not influence absorption. Nevertheless, if L is related to the width of the container, it is also correct, as it is directly proportional to absorption, that is, absorption goes up linearly as concentration rises. Lastly, lambda is partially correct as it is positively related to absorbance. However, as wavelength increases, the absorbance increases exponentially and not linearly, so lambda is not correct.	All the aspects of the equation are correct, since the volume and number of molecules relate to the concentration of the solution, which affects absorption linearly, that is, as concentration goes up, so does absorption.							14302168			The graphs worked well since they helped me visualize the outcomes more clearly than simply looking at individual numbers.

40		I believe that the formula given is indeed correct. \nThe increase in the concentration of the solution did positively affect the absorbance of the solution as seen in the formula given above. \nAs for the laser wavelength, purple wavelength is shorter in comparison to red and so it yields a smaller absorbance value thereby once again showing the positive correlation between the two variables. \nWhilst I have yet to test the laser path length through the solution, it would seem to me that increasing the length would allow more chances of the light being absorbed by the solution since the distance the light travels in the solution is longer and so might have more chances of diffracting and so increasing the absorbance value.	This should be correct as if the wavelength is set at a standard, the variables affecting the absorbance would be the number of molecules, in this case, the concentration of the solution. An increase in the concentration of the solution would cause the absorbance value to increase likewise. As for the volume of the solution in the beaker, a large volume would allow more diffraction of the laser to occur and so an increase in the volume should lead to an increase in the absorption. 							17595160			I had an idea on what variables I was going to test and so most of the lab worked out rather efficiently.

41		c is correct, because as concentration of the solution increases the absorbance increases. L is correct, as the laser path length increase, the absorbance also increases. Wavelength is incorrect, as laser wavelength increases, the absorbance of the solution decreases.	as concentration increases, the absorbance increases. concentration is the number of moles per the volume, therefore increasing the number of moles or reducing the volume of the solution would increase the absorbance. therefore N is correct and V is incorrect. 							10232160			it worked well that there were various factors that could be changed.

43		I agree with the wavelength being as it is because in this context it would imply with increase of wavelength, absorbency increases and I found this to be true in the simulation (at least). This also apples to the concentration because I found as the concentration of the solution increases, the absorbency increases. I failed to test the effect of placement of the laser and/or measuring instrument, so I'm not sure if I can account for laser path, but I tested beaker size and length of solution, and when there was a longer length the absorbency increased so I agree with this formula.	I agree with k as it sounds reasonable that specific solutions would have constants of absorbency. I agree with N as molecule # corresponds to concentration and that also increased with absorbency. V I can relate similarly to beaker size, so I agree with the formula.							17107166			I has a hard time understanding the paper questions that were given, so I would make those clearer, but the virutal lab was informative.

45		The concentration and laser path length in the equation seems to be correct in this formula. The reasoning behind this would be that the length the laser takes to get through the solution can also be referred back to the width of the beaker, so if it increases, then the absorbance will increase. Also, the concentration of the solution can also increase, which will cause the absorbance to increase. However, I am not too sure about the wavelength as red has a shorter wavelength compared to blue. If absorbance from the virtual lab showed that there was increase in absorbance from red (short wavelength), then the equation would not make sense.	This equation is correct in the aspects of the constant K. However N and V should not be multiplying each other as we want to find the concentration of the solution. While having N and V as variables in the equation, it is more suitable to understand the amount of moles in a given volume of a solution. Having N and V as multiplying variables will not help find the absorbance of light. Probably best to use N/V to find concentration and see how the absorbance is afterwards. 							11326321			I did not explore all the aspects fully. I based it off on the changing variables and played around to see how each one contributes to the database. I would explore more and understand how each one can affect the other variable rather than just isolating one of them and see how it reacts.

46		All aspects of the formula are correct, as indicated by Beer's Law.	All aspects of this formula are incorrect because it differs from the correct one given.

47		I think the formula should be the laser wavelength multiples the concentration of the solution plus the laser path length. The laser path length is important but it should not be included in multiplying the numerical concentration of solution and the color/frequency of the wavelength. 	I think it should be A = kV +N we should calculate and add onto the equation of the number of molecules. 							19089138			Testing the experiments and noting each observation was helpful. \nI think i could have spend more time trying different factors & scenarios and question myself how I can further explore this.

48		All aspects of the formula seems correct as the variables change absorbance A as expected from the virtual lab. 	All aspects but volume of the formula seem correct as k would be required depending on the solution as well as N because it's in the path of the laser. However, I believe that the volume of the solution does not matter because the laser's path does not depend on the volume nor does the laser pass through the whole volume of the container.							10970160			I really liked knowing how to play around with the virtual lab and knowing which variables I can adjust. However, I would test volume also, because I did not test that variable.

49		All three components seem correct.	It should be A=k(N/V), because (N/V) is the molarity of the solution molecules, and the absorbance increases with the molar concentration.							15317162			I should have taken a larger number of samples in order to increase the precision and of the measurement.

51		The position of c and L in the equation are correct. In the experiment, there is a positive and linear correlation between the concentration of the solution and absorbance, as well as the laser path length and absorbance. I don't think the lambda component is correct. The absorbance depends not simply on the wavelength of the laser itself, but how different the wavelength is from the emitted wavelength of the solution (aka, the colour). Therefore, A is not proportional to lambda. The absorbance increases when the difference between the emitted wavelength and solution's wavelength increases. Therefore, the correct equation is more likely to be A = (absolute difference between the wavelength of the laser and the wavelength of the solution) cL. 	N seems to represent the concentration of the solution, therefore V seems redundant, since V does not affect the absorbance. k seems correct. 							17007153			My method seemed to work well.

52		"The concentration and laser path length through the solution aspects of the formula are correct because an increase in those factors should result in the increase in absorbance by the same constant multiple.

57		 The part contains ? is incorrect. It should be 1/ ? . Because in the experiment we done just now, the graph shows when the concentration and the path length stays the same, the when y=1/ ?, the graph is a linear. 	The V part is not right. The volume is not the same as the length the laser need to pass through . In the experiment we did just now, the only thing changed is the the width it pass through. Even if they have different volume, there is still a chance that the path length they past is the same, in that case A won't change at all							13122150			The concentration and the width of the beaker can be changed. If it is possible, I would love to change the color of the solution to see if if it will also affect the Absorbence.

All of them are correct because they are all proportional to light absorbance.							15298166			I felt I explored a lot about the variables.

59		I feel the formula could not be so easy hence something has to be incorrect.

60		Absorbance is indeed proportional to the concentration and the path length through the solution. However, the formula here also uses laser wavelength which is not wrong, but it is missing the effect of the specific solution. The colour of the solution will also change the absorbance. Hence we could group the properties of the solution and the laser wavelength used into a constant that is specific to the set up we have.	The k seems to be correct. However, absorbance is not proportional the number of molecules or the volume of the solution directly. It is proportional to N/V, which is concentration. 							16606167			I thought the virtual lab was fairly intuitive but I wished it gave specific numbers for the wavelength.

61		L should be the length of the beaker instead, since this would be the distance the laser beam travels through the solution\n	This formula does not take into account the width of the beaker in which the laser beam passes through the solution. 							19989152			I did not end up moving all the factors and changing all of them.

62		I remember learning a similar formula to this in my classes as a way of converting absorbance to concentration. I don't remember it exactly as I haven't touched that material in a while but I believe this is correct. It looks like the formula we have used before so I don't think any aspects are incorrect. 	"I feel as though N does not need to be multiplied by V as the laser only goes through a portion of the beaker, not the entire beaker. Perhaps V should be, ""Volume of portion of beaker that is in path of laser"". So, I think that aspect of this formula is incorrect. "							16136159			I think trying to find patterns using the graphs worked well.

63		A is definitely proportional to the concentration and the path length, but the wavelength changes with the color of the solution, and the absorbance of the wavelength depends on the solution itself.	the volume of the solution does not matter, as long as the surface of the solution is high enough for the laser to go through. N and k are in right relationship with the absorbance, since N is proportional to the path length							18866165			everything worked well.

65		I'm a bit confused by the experimental set up. Wouldn't the monitor be detecting transmittance and not absorbance? Absorptivity is a property of an object so was that monitor taking the initial beam into account and calculating what was absorbed by the solution and reporting that number or was it reporting the light transmitted? They're related, but different.\n\n\nIf length through the solution increases more light is absorbed by the solution but less would hit the back monitor \nIf concentration increases so does absorbance\n\n	Total volume is irrelevant, the length of the pass the light travels through the solution is what really matters							13870641			The giant arrow signaled that I could change the width of the container, but I didn't think to move the monitor.

66		I feel like that makes sense. 	The volume of the beaker does not matter so this does not make sense 							11394167			I thought that the simulation worked well. It got me engaged. However if these virtual simulations are planning on replacing the physical or hands on experiences preformed in class I feel that they will not preform as well. Many kids need a hands on experience and yes this experiment does get the learning goal across but not as significantly as something hands on, because in my case, something hands on creates more memories.

67		All parts of the formula are correct in theory if one knows the composition of the solution. Since different solutions absorb different wavelengths, that will need to be factored in as well.	I believe that k and N are variables of the same line of thinking, if there is k, there should not be an N. In addition, V may account for the volume, but the width may not particularly change when the volume changes, so that part of the formula is wrong as well.							19018165			I did not discover the record data feature as the buttons were very big, so I would focus on that next time because it told me valuable information and allowed me to record my findings.

68		It is saying the A=laser wavelength times the concentration as well as the path length, but the path length is the smaller the number the smaller the abs. so the path length makes sense. But I do not think high wavelength leads to high A. So i think that part is wrong. the rest is correct.	Yes, I think this is correct. The higher the volume the higher A. The more it attenuates to the light it is higher, but it doesnt necessarily need to be a 532nm, it can be at any point it just has to be the best for the solution (having the highest value).

69		I think that the concentratin term is wrong because although wavelength and width have a direct relationship with absorbance, concentration and absorbance provide a linear graph when it is ln(abs) that is graphed against concentration, so it has a different relationship. this equation would suggest a linear relationship for a graph of absorbance vs concentration. 	I don't think V has anything to do with the absorbance.

70		Laser wavelength should not be in the formula, according to Beer's Law.  Beer's law indicates that A=(epsilon)Lc, where L and c are defined as above, and epsilon is the permitivity of the solution, or how much of the laser can go through the solution.	Volume has no relationship with absorbance; only the part where laser goes through in the solution matters.  Other variables are correct.  N is just another way of saying concentration.							12907149			I would have looked at the mathematical relationship more than just the general trend.

71		the absorbency is is the wavelength of the laser beam, c is the concentration and L is the laser path through the solution. since we know that every single one of these variables are directly proportional to the absorbency, we know that this formula is correct. 	This one. it is hard to measure the number of molecules present in the path of the laser. 							16317166			things that worked well included findign a pattern, and creating a hypothesis before starting the actual lab.

81		It is correct. The absorbance can be measured through the laser path length L in which where the detector is. As well, the concentration is a factor and it is in a 1:1 ratio, so if it changes in a unit scale, the absorbance changes along with it.	The aspects of the formula is correct as we find molar volume and the wavelength to get absorbance. The volume of the beaker and the number of molecules can help us find the concentration of the solution. 							19618321			I will investigate more on different factors in various conditions instead of just playing around.

87		lambda in the formula is incorrect because it does not affect the absorbance linearly.  It is exponential.  The c and L are correct because they affect the absorbance linearly. As well, I think there should be an X added to the equation because absorbance is only proportional to the aspects.	I dont think the volume in the beaker matters, only the volume that the laser is passing through. so N and V are incorrect.  It should be width of beaker times area of the laser passing through the solution.							19436162			Next time I would record the graphs.  It was easy to manipulate the variables and plot the data.

88		Concentration is correct, path length is correct.  I have my doubts about lambda, as it is in nm (or some measure of wavelength).  Absorbance is unitless because it's also A = log(I/(Ix)) so this equation implies that absorbance has units of nm*mol*cm.  The molar absorption coefficient epsilon should be in place of lambda as it makes the right hand side unit less (mol^(-1) * cm^(-1)). 	k is good, and N is good.   However the volume of the solution doesn't affect the absorbance at all.							17576140			I liked how I tested every variable and then went for some self planned experiments.

97		The first two parts are correct, as a higher wavelength and a higher concentration would lead to higher absorbance. However, a shorter path length would lead to higher absorbance, so the third part is incorrect.	This formula is correct. When there are more molecules, the solution is more concentrated, meaning the solution will be more absorbing. As volume increases, there will also be more absorbance, since there is more solution that can absorb things.							16328144			Changing each variable independently worked well.

102		The formula is mostly correct as absorbance can be measured using the Abs = E c l formula and that is mostly similar to the one shown above. However, wavelength is not used in the formula when calculating absorbance and is thus incorrect. Concentration and the path length of the laser are correct. 	The formula is mostly correct except for the position of the N and V variables. It should be (N/Avogadro's Number)/V in order to show concentration of the solution which does affect the measured absorbance. 							19053161			The graph worked well as it allowed me to see a trend in my data and allows one to track how absorbance would change (linearly/exponentially) if a certain variable was changed linearly.

104		Wavelength and concentration were both found to directly affect the absorbency. It is possible that these are correct. The laser path length was not measured in the trials I conducted, but based on previous  knowledge, I don't think it will be a factor. 	The concentration (number of molecules) does have an effect on the absorbency based on the previous trials, so it is possible that this is correct. The volume of the beaker also has an effect, but this was not specifically measured in the experiments just performed.							19913165			Next time, I would check the relationships between the variables to see if my associations would hold true with more than one variable being manipulated at a time.

3		From my experimentation, I found it to be true that the charge is directly proportional to the voltage and the area, but there should be a multiplicative(?) relationship between the two. I find that the constants and the addition in the formula to be false, although I must concede that a constant containing the physical properties of the circuit (such as wire and plate resistance, fluid between the plates, etc) is reasonable to include in the formula.\n\nSimilar to above, I found in the PhET simulator that the separation distance was inversely proportional to the charge. I believe the subtraction to be an error.	The direct proportionality between voltage and area is true from my experimentation. Although when the circuit was applied by a positive voltage, a positive charge became a result. As such, the negative sign should be incorrect.\n\nIn addition, the inverse squared relationship should be incorrect, as deduced from the PhET simulator. I can also consider the fact that the PhET simulator provided no option to graph y and 1/x^2, so there would be no way for the above relationship to be true.							24566161			"The data graph worked exceptionally well for me to visually observe the relationships between the factors.

4		V is the potential difference across the plate. \nThe charge, Q is not linearly proportional to the separation distance, s. The charge to separation distance should obey the inverse square law.\nThe equation should be a multiplication of both the area and potential difference since both of them are directly proportional to the charge of the capacitance. 	This formula is correct but there is no need for a negative sign in the equation. Also, there is a lack of a constant which takes into account for the magnitude of the capacitance. 							23836160			The results came out as expected from my prior knowledge.

5		I think that this formula is correct. It shows that increasing voltage and area both increase charge while the separation distance decreases the charge. Also, if you plug in a negative voltage, it would flip the sign of the charge. 	This formula shows an inverse relationship between charge and voltage which was not seen in the simulation.

6		Both the voltage and plate area parts of the equation seem to be correct however, the plate separation should be inversely related to the amount of charge on the plate. As well I don't think that this equation should have addition since when the voltage is zero the charge on the plate is zero regardless of the area of the plates or separation. I would suggest an equation where you have a constant times voltage and area divided by the plate separation	There should be a constant for the equation, as well the plate separation should be to the power of negative one not negative two. I agree with the negative sign. 							11929166			I would use less time to figure out the variables and try to start graphing as soon as possible to try to figure out a mathematical equation for the experiment.

7		I don't think separation is linearly related to the charge because the graph of separation vs charge was a decreasing exponential function. Maybe it should -k3s^2. The signs of the formula are correct because an increase in voltage and area should lead to an increase in charge and an increase in separation should lead to a decrease in charge. I also think the formula should include the absolute value of the voltage instead of just the voltage because only the magnitude of the voltage is used to determine charge.	The negative sign should be removed because the charge is positive. I think the voltage should be replaced with the absolute value of the voltage because it the charge only depends on the magnitude of the voltage. Otherwise, the relation between each variable is correct, as the charge is directly related to the area and inversely related to the separation.							85915167			Graphing the relations worked out well because it let me identify which relations were linear and which were non-linear. I would graphed the data sooner next time. Next time, I would also find the numerical relations between the variables and outcome instead of only the directional relationships.

8		Separation should have an inversely proportional relationship, so the third term should be k/s. Everything else should be proportionally correct, but I'm guessing that you're not adding these things together, rather you should be multiplying (pretty much) all of these terms together? From past physics experience, I am pretty sure that the only time you add things together is if they all have some form of distinctiveness or independence...in this lab I am sure that if I changed all three factors simultaneously that would not be true.	As I said in the last question, the inverse proportionality seems to be correct, and the fact that terms are being multiplied also seems generally correct. Also, the use of the negative sign also seems to be generally correct as it supports my data. This said, I am not so sure if s^-2 is so right though, because I'm guessing perhaps s^-1 is more realistic?							82788161			I think that virtual labs are pretty good for learning basic concepts, and it kind of makes data more tactile in some ways. I think I will use this more often when just introduced to new data (i.e.: I am completely new to the topic at hand).

9		the formula is correct if the value of voltage is a magnitude since a negative value for voltage will mean a decrease in the overall charge which is not consistent with reality and the ideal simulation, an increase in area will increase the charge and an increase in separation will decrease the overall charge making the sign in the equation adequate. 	I dont think it needs a negative sign, but the general form is good since VA are directly proportional to the charge and the separation is inverse to the charge.							15055169			It was easy to work with, next time I will try and explore further the simulation.

10		From the basic properties that was found in the experiment, the charge Q is directly proportional to area of the plates, A, battery voltage V and inversely proportional to the plate separation s. The equation should be, Q=kAV/s, where k is he proportionality constant.	From the experiment it's observed that the plate separation (s) is inversely proportional to the charge Q and not by the square of inverse. If, k=-1 is the proportianlity constant then the eqation should be, Q=-VA/s							11612162			It worked quite well. I would probably consider doing through graphs next time.

11		I believe all aspects of the formula are correct. The formula shows that the plate charge increases based on battery voltage and plate area which support the experiments I conducted. And the plate charge will decrease based on plate separation which also supports my findings. 	I think the negative sign is out of place because it shows the plate charge will always be negative which doesn't seem possible since the plate separation will always be positive since it's squared. Plate area will also always be positive since it's impossible to have a negative area. If there was a positive voltage the formula states that there will be a negative plate charge which I did not find evidence for in the experiments. 							19344143			I learned basic concepts such as relationships between plate charge and different parameters.

12		first of all the components should be multiplied not added. Although change in components is reflected by addition/subtraction, from previous knowledge of graphs, additive/subtractive relationships between variables in question do not produce graph lines obtained from experiments. Since charge is directly proportional to voltage and area, they should be in the numerator of the formula and the plate separation should be in the denominator. A common constant with consistent units can then be found.	the charge is not negative and the plate separation is not squared - since inverse graph is obtained from data collected.							61406163			I would look at all the graph options to look for anomalies or unexpected conclusions and conduct a few more runs for the experiments conducted.

13		Correct:\n- Battery voltage increases the charge Q on the plate\n- Increase in area increases the charge on the plate\n- Increase in plate separation increases the charge on the plate\nTherefore, all of the above hold true in determining the charge Q on the plate of a capacitor.	Correct:\n- An increase in voltage increases the overall charge and therefore it should be in the numerator\n- An increase in plate area increases the overall charge and therefore should be in the numerator\n- S is the factor that affects the charge Q on the plate: a increase in s leads to a decrease in Q and therefore should be on the bottom of the plate.\nIncorrect:\n- the negative sign in front of all of it; we are taking the absolute value of the charge and therefore the negative sign should not apply.							26984162			I enjoyed being able to play around with the survey and experiment with different variables.

14		I think they are all correct. But I haven't learned this topic. 	I think this is all correct since increase in area resulted in increase in charge, and increase in plate separation resulted in decrease of charge.							10375163			The simulation was well designed and I think it would help me greatly if I were to use it in a real physics lab.

15		We need to bound V by an absolute value sign since what really fits into the relationship that this equation describes is the magnitude of the plate charge. And then, the Q would be the magnitude of the charge. 	The aspect that Q is inversely proportional to s, while proportional to V and A is correct. Also, now this equation returns Q that is not only the magnitude of the charge, but the sign of it as well. However, since we have negated V, this will give us the bottom plate charge instead of the top plate charge. We need to flip the sign at the end to get the correct top plate charge. 							51717164			Most of my intuitive theories came out to be right after the experiments on the virtual lab.

17		This formula is correct in that charge increases with increasing voltage and area and decreases with increasing separation.  However, it is probably more accurate to multiply the terms.  Plate separation was also observed to have an inverse relationship with Q in the PHET, so it should be 1/s instead of -s.  	The fact that V, A increase Q while s decreases it is accurate; however, it may not be appropriate to have a negative sign and instead a constant should be multiplied by it.  Additionally, it was found to have an inverse relationship with s so the s should not be squared.							18247165			By using trial numbers to represent time, I would measure other relationships.

21		There is a small but crucial error in this equation. When V and A increase, Q will increase, and when s increases, Q decreases, which matches up with the data from the experiment. However, I do believe V and A increase Q proportionally and s decreases Q proportionally, so the formula shouldn't be addition and subtraction, but multiplication and division	The distance should not be squared. If anything, the area affected the charge more significantly than the distance, so that could be squared.							13981167			I would pay more attention to the actual numbers rather than on observing if they were increasing or decreasing.

22		The component k3s is incorrect. Based on my observations, the linear relationship exists for 1/s, not s. Hence, k3(1/s) should be plugged into the formula and not k3s.	The denominator of the formula should be s and not s^2, because a linear relationship between Q and 1/s was observed, not 1/(s^2). Secondly, there should be a constant multiplying the right hand side of the equation in order to obtain the value of Q.							561164			The ability to gather data and select which data points to add to graph. Ease of adding and deleting data points. For example, if I have three data points and find that the data points are insufficient to help me determine the shape of the graph, then I can go back to the experiment (on the same page) easily and add a few more data points. This will allow me to get a more accurate and thorough understanding of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. \n\nEven though I managed to collect results and plot graphs for each of the tested variables, I did not do a good job remembering the information. I could not even recall the shape of the graph clearly when responding to the post-activity survey. This might be because I did the task with the objective of filling out the response sheet, which is similar to completing lab sheets when doing physical lab sessions. As such, I hope that next time I use a virtual lab, I can remind myself to commit the information to memory rather than write it down, hand in the lab sheet, and forget the information which I gathered and supposedly learned.

24		I'm actually unsure how the formula for the amount of charge Q can be calculated, as I do not know how the charges are actually calculated and did not have the opportunity to look into that during the virtual lab.\n\nIt seems as though, if all it requires for the charge to be calculated is to add the possible factors together then I believe that subtracting the plate separation may be incorrect because all three factors and increase or decrease the plate charge.	I believe that the negative sign on the battery voltage constant, V, is incorrect. There is no real reason for it to be included.							17018157			I think I would definitely use the record data earlier on, as I did not use it until half way through the lab portion.

25		Instead of adding, the terms should be multiplied (and divided in the case of subtractions.)\nFor example, having 0 Voltage would result in 0 charge, but not when this formula is used. However, if multiplied, 0 Voltage (or area) would result in no charge, as expected.\n(Another scenario to consider is infinite plate separation, leading to 0 electric field and 0 charge.)\nIf it is to be changed to a formula with multiplication, then three constants are redundant, as they combine into one.	The negative sign cannot be justified with our results, as the polarity of the voltage or charge was not explored. However, the factor of two on the separation can be debunked - when increasing the separation, the charge decreased linearly, showing an inversely proportional relationship - not inverse and squared.							12707161			All the hypothesized relationships came out to be true, but I could not accurately measure the Voltage. Also, the effect of factors other than charge on the discharge of the capacitor would be interesting to investigate. (same charge, double area, double separation. Same time to discharge?

26		the only correct part is that V and A do contribute to the Q while s makes Q smaller. However the relationships of V and A were proportional to Q meaning if only A was doubled, Q would double, same if V was doubled, (assuming there is no 0 value). and s was inversely proportionate meaning if s was halved, Q was double, and if s was doubled, Q was halved. So the correct equation would be\n\nQ=(k_1V)(k_2A)/(k_3s)	The only incorrect parts are that there should not be a negative assigned to V as Q should return a posituve value if V is positive.

30		I think the voltage should be multiplied somehow rather than added as the positive or negative sign on the voltage corresponds to the positive or negative sign on the charge.  I think everything else is probably fine, as increased area would lead to a higher charge and decreased separation would also lead to a higher charge.	I think the voltage should not be multiplied by a negative one, because the sign on the voltage appears to always be the sign on the charge.  Additionally, I do not think that squaring the separation is the right ideas because although it would still allow for an increased area and decreased separation to lead to a larger absolute charge, it seems like it places too much reliance on the separation? (although the separation values are much smaller than the area even when squared, so maybe it does work)							12329163			Changing only one factor was a pretty good method as it allowed me to rule out changes from other factors, although it took quite some time and prevented me from doing trials with multiple factors involved to compare how they relate to one another.

31		It is correct that the charge on the plate is the sum of the voltage and area, since if we increase the voltage then increase the area, the charge will increase for both. If we increase the separation, however, the charge will decrease, so the separation should be minus from the total amount of charge.	the amount of charge will not be - since they depend on the type of charge that we have.

34		The correct aspects of the equation is the battery voltage and the plate area. I think the plate separation should be added because plate separation also changes the amounts of charge. 	I think this formula may be correct but I  don't think the negative sign before the battery voltage is correct. Why should it be negative? Multiplying the battery voltage and the area and then dividing by the plate separation could get you to find the charge on the plate. 							11095146			I would pay more attention to the actual numbers.

35		I believe that k1V and k2A are correct since the more we get from V and A, the larger the charge.\nHowever, for k3S, i think the separation should be k3/S.\nI'm not too sure if they should all be added and subtracted together b/c from the lab results, when the data were graphed out, they were not always linear. Some graphs had exponential growth.	I wouldn't understand why it would be negative. The charge would be positive if V was positive. I think instead, Q should be put into the absolute function if we want to find the absolute charge of the plates. I think it would make sense if s is squared since the date graphed out during the lab gave us a similar function of 1/s^2.

36		In the formula above, voltage is positive, plate area is positive, and plate separation is negative. This means that higher voltage increases the charge, higher plate area increases the charge, and higher separation decreases the charge. I agree with this. However, I do not believe that this formula is correct. Assuming voltage was 0, there should be no charge at all, regardless of plate area and plate separation. I believe the formula should be closer to Q = k1V(k2A-k3S). In this case, when voltage is zero, there will be no charge. It is important to note that the formula is probably not correct as I did not verify how exactly the 3 aspects change in relation to each other.	I believe that this is a much more accurate formula as things are multiplicative of each other. Multiplying shows that this aspect increases the charge, and dividing shows that this aspect decreases the charge. However, I don't believe that plate separation is squared. I do not recall increasing the distance to decrease the charge exponentially.							12238164			I would probably try and come up with all the different scenarios before actually going through with the virtual lab.

37		I think that the relationship between Q, V, A and s is not defined by the sum of the variables multiplied by constants k. I do think that the relationship between Q and V, A and s individually is linear, of the type Q is proportional to V or A or s, and thus Q=k1V or Q=k2A or Q=-k3s, as Q increases as V or A increases denoted by the positive constants of proportionality k1 and k2 and Q decreases as s increases as denoted by the negative constant of proportionality k3	I think that the negative sign is incorrect as the charge stored is not negative for any value of V. However, the rest of the relationships suggested by the equation ( Q inversely proportional to s^2, and directly proportional to V and A) seems to be correct							19933165			I think I could grasp some basic relationships with greater clarity and observe any changes first handedly.

38		Q depends linearly on V and A, but it depends on the inverse square of separation. Also the variable should be multiplied together and divided instead of added and subtracted.	Everything is correct except for the negative sign. A positive voltage will produce a positive charge.							19196162			Most thing worked well except I originally graphed data with multiple variables differing.

39		The formula correctly states that voltage and plate size contribute the charge whilst separation reduces it. This was shown from the simulation. The formula does not however account for the absolute value of the charges, and the scaling factor of the separation section of the equation does not match with a logarithmic trend-line like it did in the simulation graph.	This formula correctly states that voltage and area contribute to charge while separation reduces it. The separation term also has a exponent of 2. This is wrong as it gives too much weight to the separation variable. The charge is also not in absolute values, and the negative sign in front of the voltage does not seem necessary.							10420167			the graphs worked well for collecting and extrapolating data. Connections were made using the experiment and the underlying results were formulated.

40		The aspect that charge is dependent on voltage, area, and separation is correct.  This was seen how that changing voltage, area and separation all changed q.  However, the plus signs should be a multiplication sign, and the minus sign should be a division sign.  If one made the voltage 0, then no matter the area and separation, the charge was 0.  Separation should be a divide sign, as halving the distance would always double the charge.  Area should be also multiplied to V, which makes sense as doubling the area doubled the charge.  It also would make logical sense, as if A = 0, there would be 0 charge (aka, there wasn't any capacitor).	the aspects of multiplying voltage and area and dividing by s is good (see last question).  However, it should not be s^2, as when s was doubled, Q was halved, not quartered. 							17083161			Changing one variable at a time.

41		In the equation above it is shown, through, the equation that Q is directly proportional to V, which is correct as the battery voltage increases, the charge on the plate increases too. It is also seen that Q is directly proportional to A, which is also correct as the increase in the plate area causes an increase in the charge on plate. However, s is not proportional to Q, infact it is inversely proportional as when the plates were separated further, Q decreased.	s is inversely proportional however not by the square and both V and A are directly proportional and is correctly given in the equation 							12302161			I would like to test more factors and more values and probably with the availability of more different parameters and variables, eg. different plate materials.

44		The whole right hand expression should be multiplied by voltage because if voltage is zero the charge is zero\nArea and separation are not relatable quantities and cannot be added or subtracted.

48		The first term is referring to the battery voltage, which is proportional to the absolute charge on the plate. The second term refers to the plate area, which is also directly proportional to the charge on the plate. The third term, referring to the separation between plates, is inversely proportional to the amount of charge on the plates, which is why there is a subtraction in front of the third term. While increasing the battery voltage and area increase the amount of charge, increasing the plate separation decreases the amount of charge.	The voltage and area terms are correct, both are directly proportional to the amount of charge. The separation term, however, is incorrect. While it is correctly placed in the denominator, the separation term, s, should not be squared, since it is directly inversely proportional to the amount of charge.

49		I think that separation should be squared because when I graphed the relationship (charge vs separation) the relationship was not linear. It decreased exponentially. All of the other aspects seem correct as the charge vs voltage and charge vs area graphs were linear and adding area makes Q increase and adding V makes Q increase. The sign for is correct since adding separation decreases Q.	The equation should not be negative since as voltage and area increased, Q increased. s squared seems correct as the relationship between charge and separation was not linear and looked exponential.							15026512			Having the graphs there for me was extremely helpful in seeing that the relationship between charge and separation was not linear.

50		The battery voltage and plate area are correct because as they increase, so does the amount of charge on the plate of a capacitor. The plate separation is also correct because as it increases, the amount of charge on the plate decreases.	The negative sign is incorrect. This formula is saying that with a positive battery voltage, we should expect to see the amount of charge Q on the plate of a capacitor to be negative when in fact it should also be positive. The same can be said with a negative battery voltage (we should expect to see a negative charge when this formula says that it would be positive).							19416160			Overall, I got the general idea of what would happen in certain situations.

Thus, when it came to the post-activity survey asking which situation had a greater voltage, I believe I did well and was able to explain myself. However, with the formulas, I didn't know how to interpret them as well and couldn't come up with sound reasonings for my answers. I also struggled with increasing/decreasing different variables and calculating the resulting plate charge.

51		This formula is correct because a greater voltage plus a greater plate area adds to create a greater charge, Q.  A greater separation means less charge (Q), therefore it is subtracted from the total charge (of voltage and area).	The separation would not be squared because it is measuring the distance between the plates, which is a linear value. The rest of the formula seems correct...but I am not sure.							15496161			Testing out all the buttons worked well, and just figuring out relationships on my own.

52		The formula is all correct. Voltage and plate area are directly related hence they contribute to a higher charge, while separation decreases charge so it is subtracted. The constants are not rationalized so this aspect could be incorrect. 	the inclusion of voltage and area shows that the formula accounts for these two factors. However, squaring the plate separation seems incorrect because when s < 1, s^2 will be a bigger denominator than s. 							18527162			I liked how it allowed me to investigate the physics question on my own. I learned from exploring the physics concepts by playing around with virtual capacitors and plates.

53		k1V is correct because the charge Q changes based on a constant of the charge transferring to the plate as represented by k1 when attached to a battery.\nk2A is correct because the area and the charge had a linear relationship so it would be related by constant k2.\nIt is correct that these two values are positive because an increase in the voltage and increase in the plate area increased the plate charge Q.\nAn increase in the plate separation did decrease the charge Q on plate, but the relationship was not linear so there is not an appropriate constant k3 for -k3s. 	At first glance this seems decent to me. The negative sign should not be in front of VA because V and A will both increase the amount of charge Q. I am not sure whether plate separation should be squared in this equation. 							18174154			The hardest part for me was not knowing what the questions after that we would be answering would be like. I focused more on the shapes of the graphs than the specific numbers associated and therefore was kind of lost with the equation questions. What worked well for me was going through each different factor methodically so that I could see the impact of each and then further look into how multiple factors would interact with each other as well.

54		It makes sense that with greater s there is less charge. I would assume this to be correct from my findings, as they followed this sort of trend.	This seems to make more sense than the last equation for as s drecreases, the value of Q would increase. I'm unsure if this needs to be negative however.							13134165			I should have had more background knowledge of the lab so I could apply my knowledge with more depth.

55		All aspects of the formula are correct. Because to find the amount of charge Q on the plate of a capacitor one must add the plate area and subtract the separation because these contribute to how little or how large the charge is. 	To find the charge Q on the plate of the capacitor this would be a correct formula. the charge is equal to the negative voltage multiplied by the plate area and divided by the plate separation squared because the plate separation directly impacts the voltage in the plate.							11384795			Next time I would attempt to more thoroughly play around with the virtual lab and attempt every different option that there is available.

57		k2A is correct because larger area=more charge and -k3s is right because the smaller the distance, the more charge so it should be negative. however, when I did the experiment, I did not check to see if voltage had an effect as I only did separation and area, therefore, I do not know if k1V is right.	I dont understand why it would be a negative equation.

59		There is nothing wrong with this formula.

60		All aspects of the formula are correct; as plate area and voltage increase, the plate charge Q would also increase (as observed in the virtual lab), which is why both V and A are positive. As plate separation increases, plate charge Q should decrease, which is accurately represented with a negative sign in front of s in this formula.	The relationship between V, A, and Q is correct, seeing as both voltage and area are directly proportional to the charge Q. s^-2 is also correct, because charge Q and separation s have inversely proportional relationships. The only inaccurate part is the negative sign; the formula should describe the absolute plate charge, so Q should always be positive.							11777163			" - Changing only one variable at a time helped to isolate exactly how that variable affected the plate charge instead of changing all the variables simultaneously\n- Next time, I will use the provided graph function more to plot the exact mathematical relationship between variables and plate charge, instead of just vaguely stating ""plate charge increases as plate separation decreases"""	Somewhat	Mostly	Not at all	Mostly	Almost always	Almost always	Often	Sometimes	Almost always		larger plates (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/bigPlates_10V.png)	higher voltage battery (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/bigPlates_10V.png)	 (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/23165/storage/equal2.png)	smaller separation (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/bigPlates_10V.png)	 (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/23165/storage/equal2.png)	Both scenarios have the same absolute battery voltage charge, plate separation distance, and plat area.

62		The k1V for battery voltage is correct. Battery voltage, when increased, leads to an increase in the amount of charge Q on the plate of a capacitor. The k2A part is also correct as the larger the plate area, the higher the plate charge. The k3S part I believe is correct as well. The larger the separation, smaller the amount of charge Q. It makes logical sense to add a negative sign in front of k3S as S increases, the amount of plate charge decreases. It is inherently taking away the amount of charge already formed on the plate when separation of plates occurs. 	I believe the form of the fraction -VA/s^2 is correct but I do not believe that s should be squared. Variable s should be raised to the power of 1 only because this way it still has the power to reduce the amount of charge Q on the plate of the capacitor. Raising s to the power of 2 seems unnecessary. Also, I believe that the negative sign should not be present, as the amount of charge is a positive value. It is impossible to have negative AMOUNTS OF charge, but negative charge is possible.							16657165			The accessibility of all the buttons (variables) made it easy for me to test all of them out. I like the record data button and plotting function, it becomes much easier to record them on the computer than by hand. This lab was very well done.

63		The higher the voltage, the greater the charge, so a positive addition of V is correct. The greater the area, the greater the charge, so a positive addition of A is also correct. Lastly, as plate separation increases, charge decreases, so subtracting s is correct. 	Since a voltage is needed before plate area and separation affect the charge, multiplying the variables by V is correct. I am unsure of the negative sign, and why s is to the power of two. 							13945160			Testing out the plates and how they charge the light bulb under different conditions helped a lot.

64		I think all aspects of the formula are correct, although there should be an absolute value sign around the voltage. All three variables affect the charge on the place of a capacitor. Since voltage and area have positive correlations with the charge, they have a positive sign in front of them. Since the plate separation has a negative correlation with the charge, it has a negative sign.	All aspects of the formula are correct. The charge is inversely proportional to the square of the plate separation, since as plate separation decreases, the charge increases. Charge is directly proportional to voltage and area because as they increase, the charge increases as well.							13140165			I found that keeping all the variables constant except for one was helpful because I could figure out if that variable had a direct correlation with the charge. However, next time I would create graphs of the data in order to figure out the relationship between the variable and the charge (1st order, 2nd order, etc.).

65		The charge, Q, is directly proportional to the voltage of the battery and the area of the plate, but is inversely proportional to the plate separation. When nothing else is changed except a decrease in plate separation, an increase in charge is observed. An increase in plate separation decreases the charge. The formula should be Q = (V*A)/s when the constants are omitted. 	There should not be a negative sign in this formula because increasing the voltage and/or the area will increase the charge Q. Charge is directly proportional to voltage and area, so the sign of both sides of the function should be positive.							14055131			Try adjusting everything at once and seeing the effect; i.e. altering the plate separation and area and the direction of charge.

66		incorrect elements:\n- k1V is incorrect, because since negative voltage produce a negative charge, if the plate area is large enough, it could make the K1V term positive, which could give a positive charge\n- k3s is incorrect because if increasing the separation of the places cause the charge to decrease logarithmically, the term should include log \ncorrect elements:\n- k2A is correct because as area increases Q is expected to increase\n	1. because having a positive voltage gives a positive charge, this formula is incorrect since it would result in a negative Q\n2. 1/s^2 is incorrect because although there is a negative correlation between the separation of plates and charge, the trend is logarithmic according to experimental results							12816168			as a visual learner, it was nice to see a realistic experimental set-up of the concept\ni wouldve preferred to see the electrons physically move (ie the internal mechanisms that cause the trends to exist)\ni wouldve also liked to input my own numbers for the independent variables rather than adjusting a lever/switch on the screen	Somewhat	Mostly	Somewhat	Somewhat	Almost always	Almost always	Almost always	Sometimes	Almost always		smaller plates (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/smallPlates_10V.png)	higher voltage battery (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/bigPlates_10V.png)	larger plates (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/bigPlates_0V.png)	smaller separation (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/bigPlates_10V.png)	 (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/23165/storage/equal2.png)	the absolute amount of battery voltage in the two diagrams is the same, hence the absolute voltage battery is the same	two large plates perfectly aligned (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/user/27714/storage/bigPlates_10V.png)	there is more area for the two plates to overlap and thus there is more charge		2		1		1		4	Mostly	Somewhat	Mostly	Somewhat	Mostly	Mostly	Mostly	Mostly	Not at all	Definitely	Definitely	Mostly	Mostly	Definitely	Mostly	Mostly	Definitely	Definitely	Not at all	Mostly	Definitely	Definitely	Somewhat	Definitely	Definitely					Capacitance	1	12816168

Yes, this formula seems correct.

68		I believe the charge per area is misrepresented in this formula, as I believe the formula should have some product operation rather than just simple addition and subtraction.  For instance, the relationship between current, voltage and resistance (if I remember correctly) is a product relationship where current is equal to the number of volts divided by the resistance which will decrease the charge.  The inverse relationship would make sense in this scenario as well, as increasing resistance (or separation) will decrease the voltage or overall charge.	S is right and should be at the denominator, as if you increase the separation, the magnitude of the charge will decrease and vice-versa.  I'm not sure about the negative sign in front of VA - if voltage is negative then the charge will be negative unless we are trying to determine the absolute value of the charge in this experiment.							15160164			The user interface was clean and straightforward, something I think a lot of labs overlook in the process of designing it.

69		The component k1V is correct as it implies that as V increases so does Q. The aspect k2A is also correct as it implies that as area increases so does the charge. The segment -k3s is also correct as it implies that as the separation between plates increases, the charge goes down. This term however is incorrect in the sense that when I did the virtual lab, I noticed the trend was not linear for separation and would therefore need some sort of exponential or inverse term which brings the value of Q down as separation is increased.	All three components are correct as V and A both increase the value of Q as they get bigger and as S gets bigger, it decreases the value of Q. The negative is a bit off though and should just be a component of the voltage depending on which plate charge is being calculated. 							17168593			After doing this, I wish there were more options such as graphing voltage so I could have had a clearer idea of the mathematical relationship to do with voltage.

70		Rather than being added together, these things should be multiplied together and there is no need for constants since everything is directly proportional. The formula should look more like this:\nQ=(AV)/s	"The multiplication part is correct, and the variables are in the right places, but the ""s"" should not be squared and there should not be a negative sign."							17347163			I might have collected more data, or worked faster.

71		The effect of V, A, and s can't be in separate terms because I found them to be proportional (inversely, for s) to the absolute charge. If they contributed to the charge separately, we could only find proportional relationships for a factor when the other two factors are zero. We know this not to be the case - this is best illustrated by zero voltage and varying A and s - Q is zero no matter what. (This leads me to think the relationship has VA/s somehow, possibly with a constant since we didn't have the value for the voltages.)	"The s should not be squared. In the simulation, doubling s halved Q. With the square in the formula, doubling s would decrease Q by 1/4.\nI don't think it's appropriate to use a negative sign, since there isn't much in the way of defining which plate we're talking about (one plate is positive, one plate is negative). It would probably be better to just use absolute charge and voltage. That being said, we can't completely ignore the effect of the voltage's sign on which plate is positive and which is negative (this doesn't directly relate to the question though, since it defines Q as the ""amount of charge on the plate of the capacitor"" without saying which plate it is).\nI think the placement of V and A in the numerator with powers 1 are appropriate since doubling V and doubling A without changing other factors both doubled the absolute plate charge."							14261165			I'd like to combine more factors and not just test one at a time to make my predictions/conclusions about how they affect plate charge more reliable. I wanted to explore the discharging through the light bulb more, and use the graph to do so, but unfortunately it didn't let me graph time on the x axis.

77		The formula is incorrect. Adding up the variables multiplied with their constants does not give you the charge.

87		I think all aspects of the formula is correct, except whether or not the plates are perfectly aligned or offsetted should be taken into consideration. Perhaps another variable could be added to include that. The current aspects of the formula are correct, such as: the higher the voltage, the higher the plate charge; the bigger the plate area, the higher the plate charge; the higher the distance of separation, the lower the plate charge.	I don't think this formula is correct.

92		the -k3s aspect of the formula is almost certainly incorrect, as that would suggest that a decrease in k3s would lead to a linear increase in the charge Q, but my observations in the laboratory suggested that decrease in separation causes an exponential increase in charge. The rest of the formula is most likely correct.	Alright, I would say that in comparison to the formula shown just before, this should be much more accurate in the relation between changes in s and Q, though i believe the negative sign isn't necessarily needed and there should be a constant present, as the factors do not simply cause change suggesting multiplication of value. perhaps the proper formula uses (kV+kA)/s^2?							15749160			I do feel like I quickly developed and understanding of the individual factors within the formula, and the basis for logical approach to solving these problems.

97		All the aspects correspond to the patterns of determining plate charge. The battery voltage and area aspects in the formula are positive because they are positively correlated with charge, which plate separation is negatively correlated with charge and is therefore subtracted. Based on this reasoning, the formula should be accurate for calculating plate charge (Q).	The battery voltage component should be accurate because the top plate charge is proportional to the negative battery voltage. The other two components might be accurate. 							17655165			Observing changes in variables individually, and then combining the changes.

The absorbance does not depend on the volume of the solution but it depends on the concentration of it. So the equation is not right.

In fact some wavelengths might be absorbed less even though they are longer. 	This equation is incorrect in the assumption that the volume of the beaker will affect the absorbency of a specific wavelength.

A 1.0M beaker of aqueous NaCl should not have the same absorbance of a 1.0M beaker of aqueous Pt.\n\n2. (My written response to the activity may be the reverse of what I write now). It should be true that an increase in the concentration and laser path would lead to an increase in absorbance.\n\n3. I am unsure that the wavelength has a direct linear relationship, since I found that the blue laser resulted in the least absorbance whereas the purple wavelength on the far left of the slider resulted in a higher absorbance. I am unsure whether this scale is on a wavelength scale, or simple a color wheel meant to wrap around and continue.	1. I do believe that a constant should be used since the absorbance of a material should vary from different materials. However, it should not be at a certain wavelength, and wavelength should be incorporated separately in the equation.\n\n2. Number of molecules is definitely a factor in the absorbance.

7	18-19	I guess that seems about right. The direct proportionalities that I've discovered through the virtual lab seem to match up with those of the formula?? Although the only thing that seems questionable is that there is no direct proportionality with the wavelength I think. The wavelength of the absorbed ray should be taken relative to the color of the liquid you're currently experimenting with.	I think the use of k being specific to a certain wavelength is accurate. I also think that the use of number of molecules is good, although it probably would be better if it were the average concentration, assuming equal mixing throughout I suppose. And probably it should also account for the distance traveled by the light, so probably include some term D.

Except this time, instead of trying to generalize a formula, since the wavelength aspect of it was not as obvious, I literally just drew a graph, which I think would be clear enough for this situation, more or less. Again, I tried seeing key relationships and then graphing them.	It overall went pretty well I guess. But next time, perhaps I will start with the simulation, and then Google the formula to see how close I am. Perhaps that will enforce the concept even more?

8	18-19	I think the formula is correct because by changing on of the variables while keeping the other constant, a linear relationship can be found with regards to the variable's relation to the absorbance. This corresponds with the findings in the lab simulation. However, perhaps coefficients have to added to variables to make sure the proper relation is kept.	I think the formula should have the volume being divided by the the number of moles because the concentration is found by dividing the volume from the number of moles, not by multiplying the number of moles and volume together. I think the use of the constant in front of the NV term is correct as it represents a direct relation between the wavelength and absorbance.

The volume should not be included as it plays no role according to this experiment as it was not a factor to be adjusted.  Using N sounds like it could be good, but I suspect that using this value would take far more work than just using the distance the light travels in the solution and the concentration, and additionally, as molecules are in constant motion I am unsure as to how this value could be obtained accurately.

I think this make sense because absorbance depends on how crowded, how much molecules are in the solution and volume of the solution.

This formula makes sense for k and N, as it makes sense that the calculation is different for each wavelength, as seen in the experiment.

39	18-19	I believe that this formula is almost correct. The formula shows that concentration and laser path length increase the absorbance. However, laser wavelength in this formula also increases absorbance. In other words, a longer wavelength increases it. I don't believe this is correct.

Dividing a smaller number would then increase absorbance.	It cannot be determined if the N or if V is what had affected what changed the absorbance. The only thing I changed that could possibly determine this is the width of the beaker. However, increasing the beaker width increased both N and V. In the formula, k is a constant so it should have no problem stay as is.\nPersonally, my gut instinct from the start told me that the equation should be dependent on N and not V, but as I do not have proof as to if this is true, I will say that A = kNV is correct as N and V are pretty much directly related to each other.

40	18-19	It is incorrect that A is directly proportional to the laser wavelength, as at the wavelength equal to the wavelength of the color of the solution, the absorbance was at its minimum and increased a little more again. Although it isnt directly proportional there was a trend seen that increasing the wavelength increased the absorbance. The concentration is also proportional to the absorbance as when the concentration of the solution increased the absorbance increased in almost the equal amount too.The laser path length was not directly proportional as as long as the the detector was kept after the beaker, the readings were the the same throughout.	The absorbance was directly proportional to the concentration as in the simulation it was seen that doubling the concentration would approximately double the absorbance reading too. Furthermore, increasing the beaker size meant the volume of solution also increases, thus when the beaker size was increased from 1cm to 2 cm, the absorbance reading also increased by two approximately.

46	18-19	This equation seems mostly correct. I have already identified that absorbance is directly related to both the concentration of the solution as well as the length the light must travel through the solution. It is not, however, directly dependent on the laser wavelength. It is dependent upon how closer the laser's wavelength is to the wavelength of the colour of the solution. Because that is not expressed in this equation, it does not hold true.	This equation has the same problem as the other one. Two of the quantities are correct and one is not. Here, having the k constant correctly identifies the relationship between the wavelength of the light and the absorbance as a property of the solution. It also expresses a linear relationship between the number of molecules in the path of the laser (encompassing both path length and concentration), and absorbance. The volume of the solution, however, is not relevant. Only the path the light travels through affects the absorbance, not the overall amount of liquid.

48	18-19	The concentration and the laser path length in this equation are correct. They are both directly proportional to the absorbance. I think the only mistake, if any, would be the wavelength term. I wasn't quite able to find a solid mathematical relationship between the wavelength and the absorbance since there were no numerical values associated with the wavelength on the simulation. I did, however, try to conduct an experiment by changing wavelengths, holding everything else constant, and tried to make each change in wavelength approximately the same, and plotted the absorbance vs. trial number. This graph did not look linear, so based on my experience in the virtual lab, I don't think that there is a direct linear relationship between absorbance and wavelength.	I think the terms referring to the constant, k, and the number of molecules of the solution in the path of the laser, N, are correct. They both influence how much light is absorbed in the solution. I don't think that the volume of the solution in the beaker affects the light absorbance, and don't think it should be in the equation. The absorbance only depends on the path the light takes, not what is above or below it, so as long as the absorbance is measured through the solution, it does not matter how much of the solution there is.

Fluent	Fluent				1.0	19416160	*Non science or applied science major	In this second virtual lab, I looked more closely at the numbers as I changed the different variables (instead of just looking at whether it increased/decreased the value). However, I still used the same technique where I changed one variable from one extreme to the other and observed its results, then went on to change other variables one at a time while keeping the first variable I tested constant.	By looking at the numbers closely this time, it made the formula and calculation questions a lot easier. However, it may have distracted me and made the other portion of the post-activity survey (which scenario has greater light absorbance) harder as I couldn't remember the wavelength spectrum as well as the results of the first experiment (I believe I paid too much attention to the numbers and thus couldn't remember as many details). Next time, I would try to even out what I focused on in the first and second virtual labs, focusing on both the numbers and specific details at the same time and not paying too much attention to one but not the other.

52	20-22	The concentration and the laser path length do both have positive relationships to the absorbance A of a solution so those aspects would be correct and amplify (shown by the multiplication here) each other. The wavelength isn't that straight forward as different solutions absorb different wavelengths and therefore this cannot be used in the equation in this way to find absorbance of a solution without further data. 	This equation represents the constant that is requir3ed for different wavelengths in a solution so that is correct for K. N representing the number of molecules of the solution in the path of the laser is similar to representing the concentration of a solution so that is correct. V for volume of beaker may or may not be correct dependent on if volume only changes given width or if it can get taller too. If the vial being measured with increases height of liquid then there would be no impact so V needs to be better specified.

That being said, I also feel like this lab took me longer to investigate because I had more goals to learn going into it and therefore I was not able to necessarily complete every part of the lab that I wanted to experiment with. Because I could not figure out a way to change solutions I first familiarized myself with how that solution reacted at all different wavelengths and then chose a wavelength to study with through throughout the course of the remainder of experiments I did. From there I graphed relationships between single factors and absorbance and then just barely had time to start experimenting with different wavelengths and multiple variables at once.	Next time given the same time constraint I would try to be more time efficient since that was my biggest downfall here. Overall I believe my approach worked well. I think if I had been able to take notes with me from the virtual lab to the post-activity I would have had much more clarity answering these questions as well.

62	18-19	This formula is correct in two respects; the concentration and path length. Both are linear relationships and this is seen in the equation. However, it is not possible to quantify the wavelength as it is quantified here as the relationship between the wavelength and the absorbance depends on the type of solution.

The exploration followed by data collection worked well again.

64	20-22	The absorbance depends on the wavelength, concentration, and path length through the solution (= beaker width). The absorbance is inversely proportional to the laser wavelength, so should be on the bottom of the formula: A = c*L/lambda. It was found that as the wavelength of light increases, the absorbance decreases. However this also depends on the solution present. If the solution is the same (in this case, only made up of one type of molecule), this effect can be ignored.	The absorbance is a function of N/V, the molar concentration of the solution. So for the formula to correctly describe how the concentration of a solution at a specific wavelength affects its absorbance, the volume needs to be the denominator: A=k*N/V	Fluent	Fluent				1.0	14055131	General Science	Knowing how long it would take to get familiar with the program I was able to delegate more time to thinking about the output of changing the variables.

The red laser beam has a smaller wavelength than the blue laser beam so if the solution absorbs long wavelengths of light (small lambda value) then it will have a higher absorbancy.

This is assuming that red side of the spectrum has a higher wavelength number compared to the blue side of the spectrum which should have a lower wavelength number. As concentration increases so does absorbance and finally as the laser path length increases through cuvette so does absorbance. 	As volume increases and molecules is constant, the concentration of the solution effectively goes down which means that the absorbance should also go down.

The solution we used in the simulation had lowest absorbance in the middle of the visible spectrum (around blue/cyan/green). Staring from there, increasing or decreasing the wavelength of the light led to higher absorption (non-linear, but likely continuous). (The proposed formula would indicate linearly increasing absorbance with increasing wavelength always). I think some constant could be used, but the constant would have to be defined differently depending on the solution used. I am also concerned there will be multiple absorption peaks/mins for some solutions.	I agree with the need for some constant specific to the wavelength of light we are looking at as well as the involvement of N (this can account for A being proportional to the beaker width and solution concentration). I don't think V is correct, since N already accounts for width and concentration (there are no other factors we have discovered to be important). Even if we did not use N, V would not be correct, as the light is only absorbed by particles it hits (this is why the absorbance changes linearly along the width of the beaker when you move the deterctor horizontally). As long as the particles in the path of the light do not change, it does not matter how much solution there is elsewhere.

90	20-22	I think this formula is correct. Long wavelengths, higher concentrations of the solution, and longer laser path lengths through the solution yields higher light absorption. On the other hand, short wavelengths, lower concentrations of the solution, and shorter laser path lengths through the solution yields lower light absorption.	I think this formula is incorrect. The volume of the solution in the beaker has nothing to do with how much light is going to be absorbed.	Fluent	Fluent				1.0	17112137	Psychology	I tried out all the functions individually and looked at how each specific factor affected the amount of light absorbed. This time, I spent a little more time playing around with the virtual lab and made sure to pay attention to the numbers and how much or less they changed every time I manipulated one of the factors.	I think I understood the basic concepts of the virtual lab quite well, and was also able to establish basic patterns. Next time, I would probably take a bit more notes and maybe use a graph to illustrate the concepts.

94	18-19	Wavelength isn't present in the formula. A constant should be there in it's place. I know this because the wavelengths producing greater values of A just relates to the composition of the solution being tested.	Here the mistake is that they use volume in the formula, which isn't going to make sense. Absorbance is determined by the change in the light's intensity (or something along those lines) after it passes through the solution. the volume of the solution is irrelevant to this because no matter how much solution is above the section being tested, the light simply will not pass through that area. 	Fluent	Fluent		1.0			15749160	Psychology	I have done 2 colorimetry laboratories before, so I somewhat knew what to do and what the formula should look like. Anyways, I first found the analytic wavelength, then I plotted Concentration vs Absorbtion with constant width, then I plotted width vs. absorbtion to confirm that that too was a linear relationship.	Knowing what to expect helped alot. Planning was essential in producing the graphs, which I would have needed to calculate the constant.

Ultimately, I made the decision because light passing through more medium that absorbs it will result in a higher absorbance calculation.	 (https://survey.ubc.ca/media/assets/groups/5494/Notenoughinfo.png)	Another tricky question, but I am certain that there isn't enough information given. The solution absorbs lights of different wavelengths greater or lesser based upon the solutions properties, there is no actual correlation between greater or lesser wavelength and absorption that is general for all liquid solutions that can be tested. If the solution was specified as actually being violet, however, I would probably say that the blue laser solution has higher absorption.	0.1		0.4		0.8		0.2		Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Somewhat	Mostly	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Definitely	Mostly	Definitely	Definitely	Mostly	Definitely	Definitely	Not at all	Definitely	Somewhat	1.0				Absorbance	2	15749160
98	18-19	The magnitude of the laser wavelength is not proportional to the absorbance, as in the virtual lab, the lowest absorbance was observed with a blue wavelength, when violet light has the lowest wavelength.The concentration and path length are accurate because they are both positively correlated with the absorbance of the solution. 	The number of molecules in the path is related to the concentration of the solution, which is positively correlated with the absorbance so this aspect is accurate. The absorbance is not dependent on the volume of solution so this aspect is inaccurate.
