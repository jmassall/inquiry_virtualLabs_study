CVS in graph
	How many students are doing CVS for each variable?
		-> quant variables similarly likely, qual variables much less
	When they do CVS, how many points do they take?
		*avgs without zeros
		-> qual/quant different?
		-> quant difference accross sims?
		-> qual difference accross sims?
	Great so they use it, but are students consistent in their use of CVS accross sims?
		* HEATMAP by number of variables, one sim per axis
		-> if consistent, then the behavior we are capturing is likely to be the exhibition of some strategy, and students are using this strategy systematically.
		-> but also graphs take more time...
	Does order matter in their consistency?
		* HEATMAP
		-> Hypthesis, LC will be caps variable heavy and vice versa
		-> if used CVS previously, using it more second sim since it helped them succeed?
	Let's dig deeper into how order matters and how the sims are different/same and what that tells us about student learning inquiry.
	Does order matter in terms of the number of points in they CVS? (More = more deliberate, better sampling)
		*avgs without zeros
		-> consistent increase accross all variables when second sim
	Does order matter in terms of student doing CVS at all?
		-> Area, separation: increase of graph+table and decrease of doing neither when caps activity is second
		-> Wavelength,width,concentration: increase of graph+table and decrease of just table when beers activity is second

Effect of changing from 2 to 3 points.

On a per variable basis, it lowered the rate at which students are doing CVS in the table for all variables by 10%-14%. Nothing worrying here. It makes the detector more stringent, which is what we wanted.
For the graph, there is a also a decrease though it's quite negligeable and there really isn't that much change at all. This is no surprise since if you remember the histogram graphs, most students do CVS in the graph with 4-6 points or more, so dropping those that do it only with two makes little difference.

So are patterns remain:
	Activity order of sim has a consistent effect for all variables on the number of datapoints taken -> learning?
	Activity order has an effect on the likelihood a student does CVS with a certain variable 
		in table
			Caps quantitative variables are captured by CVS more when LC
			No difference for Beers quantitative variables
			No difference for qualitative variables
				-> sims are different 
		in graph
			All variables except 
			Caps quantitative variables are captured by CVS more when caps activity second
			Beers qual and quant variables are captured by CVS more when beers activity second
			No difference for Caps qualitative variable (battery voltage)
				-> quant variables of sims are similar, qual/quant are different, both qual variabes are different
	Activity order has am effect on the likelihood that a student does CVS in both the table and graph than just the table on all variables except Battery voltage -> learning!
		Area, separation: increase of graph+table and decrease of doing neither when caps activity is second
		Wavelength,width,concentration: increase of graph+table and decrease of just table when beers activity is second
