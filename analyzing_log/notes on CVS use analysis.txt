point of looking at this data is to get a sense of the number of students doing this behavior that relates to CVS strategy.

Some basic questions we want to answer are: are their behaviors similar in both sims? does order matter? Are parallel variables parellel?
how comon is CVS? How should we tweek our definition of CVS in graph or table?


-----OBSERVATIONS------

16 - LIKELYHOOD PER VARIABLE
	~ 70% of students run CVS in table for a variable, except battery voltage which is 60%
	~fr graph it's around 50% excet for wavelength (42) and battery (32)
13-15 - OVERALL VARIABLES
	3/4 of sstudents do CVS on a total of 3/6 variables. students tend to do CVS in table for more variables thn graph. Graph is more uniformly distributed in terms of # of variables. -> graph is more detailed look at certain variables.
4-8 SAMPLING NUMBER
	If CVS in graph, tend to use 4 points or more. It's more uniform for table CVS.
	wavelength and table more likely not to get graph CVS (by 10%)
22 ORDER EFFECT ON LIKELYHOOD
	in table, 14% increase in CVS likelihood for Caps vars (not battery -2%)
	no changes or slight drop for beers
	in graph, 12 % and 18% increase for searation and area when caps second sim
	7 and 4 % increase for width and concentration when beers second
23 ORDER EFFECT ON TABLE OR BOTH
	Area - movment from none and only table to both
	separation - more both
	width and concentration, if beers second, more likely to both, same amount of none
19-20 ORDER EFFECT ON SAMPLING
	if second sim, great sampling number (for all variables!)


OVERALL - order matters,it chnages behavior. sims are different,ppossibly due to familiarity. qual variables are harder to plot/interpret/analyze and done so less. other variable are somehwat similar in samling numbers and likelihoods.
